# This script returns the Mumble version string for a Mumble Git
# repository. The script must be run from within a Mumble Git
# repository.
# This is a replacement for `git describe` to make snapshots
# use the future, untagged version number rather than the previous.
#
# The version is of form 1.3.0~2020-07-02~g4f336a2~snapshot.
# It includes the target release version rather than the previous
# release (as git describe does).
#
# Detailed description:
#
# Once upon a time, Mumble used the output of `git describe` as
# its version string.
#
# If a commit was tagged, it was a "release", and got a simple
# string which was the name of the tag.
#
# If a commit wasn't tagged, it got '1.2.6-234-gf552ag1', which
# consists of the number of commits since the latest tag, and
# the commit hash of the latest commit.
#
# However, the output of `git describe` was found to be confusing
# in practice. This is because the base version of the `git describe`
# output is the latest tag, which is to say: the *previous*
# version of Mumble.
#
# So, a user running a snapshot that would become 1.3.0 would be
# running a version like 1.2.6-234-gf552ag1. This is confusing
# simply by looking at the version numbers, but the way versioning
# works inside the Mumble client made it worse: the client's version
# was referred to as "1.3.0" in several places, but the actual version
# number said 1.2.6-234-gf552ag1.
#
# This script is the replacement for `git describe`. It outputs the
# *actual* base version of the Mumble tree, rather than the latest tag.
# This means that snapshots for Mumble 1.3.0 now have the base version
# '1.3.0'.
#
# It also changes the version string: Instead of using dashes
# as a separator in the version string, it now uses tildes. This allows
# Debian's dpkg version comparer to correctly sort snapshot versions
# before release versions. The new string also includes 'snapshot' in the
# version string to denote to users that the given version is a pre-release
# snapshot.
# Furthermore the version number does use the latest commit's date rather
# than therevision number since the last tag.
# A full new-style version string looks like this:
# 1.3.0~2020-07-02~g4f336a2~snapshot.
